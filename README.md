# NENA i3 Standard for Next-Generation 9-1-1 Core Services

The NENA i3 Standard provides the detailed functional and interface specifications for a post-transition IP-based multimedia telecommunications system, including the Core Services and legacy gateways necessary to support delivery of emergency calls via an IP-based Emergency Services IP network.

This repository includes the OpenAPI interface definition as a YAML object for web Services defined in the i3 standard. Interfaces are described using OpenAPI V3, with JSON-ld exchange schemas for NIEM conformance.

Definitions in this repository were originally made normative in NENA-STA-010.3-2021. The current version of the standard and NENA standards development procedures are available at: https://nena.org/standards
